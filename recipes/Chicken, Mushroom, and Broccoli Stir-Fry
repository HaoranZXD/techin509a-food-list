# Chicken, Mushroom, and Broccoli Stir-Fry:

## Ingredients:

- ** 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
- ** 2 cups broccoli florets
- ** 2 cups sliced mushrooms
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons oyster sauce
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1/4 cup chicken broth or water
Salt and pepper, to taste
Cooked rice, for serving
Instructions:

In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, cornstarch, and chicken broth. Set this sauce mixture aside.

Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces and cook until they are no longer pink in the center, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the cooked chicken from the skillet and set it aside.

In the same skillet, add a little more oil if needed and then add the minced garlic. Saut√© the garlic for about 30 seconds, or until it becomes fragrant.

Add the sliced mushrooms to the skillet and cook them for 2-3 minutes until they start to soften.

Add the broccoli florets to the skillet and stir-fry for an additional 3-4 minutes, or until the broccoli is tender and bright green.

Return the cooked chicken to the skillet and pour the sauce mixture over the chicken, mushrooms, and broccoli.

Cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens and everything is heated through, about 2-3 minutes.

Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Serve your delicious Chicken, Mushroom, and Broccoli Stir-Fry over cooked rice and enjoy!
